# ming-data

This repository contains .csv files of data extracted from Ming sources.

Unless otherwise noted, each file contains data from a single text, which is noted according to the following naming convention:

Data_Source.vol.csv

For example:

河泊所_大明會典.36.csv contains data on 河泊所 (mooring stations) from the Da Ming huidian 大明會典 vol. 36

Unless otherwise noted, the data is transformed only in the following ways:

1. Conversion of Chinese to Arabic numerals (i.e. 四百五十二 --> 452)
2. Organization into columns.
3. Extrapolation of row labels based on the title given at the beginning or end of a section.
